#### We have EDA and Model Evalution files of the project
#### Three models—Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree Classifier—are used in the model evaluation. The target variable ("reordered"), which indicates whether the consumer is ready to order the prior purchase from the cart, has been tuned using these models. 
#### We have the k-means clustering where we create few of the clusters based on the elbow method from the graph of the data. The association rule method is used to tune the data.


#### The product recommender file helps us to create the data into clusters and groups them accordingly.

#### The streamlit file is where we are able to interact with the online user interface to find out the predictions.
